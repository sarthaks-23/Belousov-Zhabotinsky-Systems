# Belousov-Zhabotinsky-Systems
A SURGE'25 Research Project, where we have done modelling and experimentation of Belousov-Zhabotinsky Systems, simulated and trained a model with 90.5% accuracy, which would match with our experiments. We have got at an average 45 seconds oscillation time period (between red and blue color of solution).
